    Attributes:
        disconnect_fully_revokes: Whether ``revoke_token`` removes the
            user's portal-level OAuth grant.

            When ``True``, calling
            :meth:`~apron_auth.client.OAuthClient.revoke_token` is
            sufficient to force a fresh consent screen on the next
            authorization flow — enabling automatic scope-reduction
            (tier 1) end-to-end inside the OAuth flow.

            When ``False``, revocation only invalidates the current
            token. A subsequent authorization flow reuses the existing
            portal-level grant and the user keeps their previously-
            granted scopes regardless of what's requested. Consumers
            must surface a deep link to the provider's app-management
            settings (tier 3) for the user to remove the grant
            manually.

            Defaults to ``False``. Over-claiming silently breaks scope
            reduction; under-claiming harmlessly falls back to the
            manual deep-link path.
